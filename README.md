# QCalculator
 A Python script used to notify the user when the expected queue time is below 5 minutes.

I ran into an issue trying to play World of Warcraft during peak hours like Friday nights, it could be up to 90 minutes of expected time spent in a queue. :no_good:
So instead of waiting and watching the queue, I could use this script to notify me when it's close to ready. 

Using Pillow to grab images and Python-tesseract to read those images. Then notify via a Discord channel. :mega:
